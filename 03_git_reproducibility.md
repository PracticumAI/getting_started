## Summary

**Applied AI is powered by code--Python code.**

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/practicumai.github.io/main/images/features/Jupyter_logo.svg' align='left' alt='Jupyter logo' style="padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px">In most cases, especially in the early testing and development stages, AI code is most easily written, and run, using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks, an open standard allowing documents to mix formatted text and images with interactive code and the results from running that code.

Part of this module will also get you up and running in one of many available Jupyter systems. We will walk you through some of the options and provide step-by-step instructions to get started.

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/getting_started/main/images/Git-Logo-2Color.svg' align='right' width=100 alt='git logo'>As a best practice, code should reside in a version control system. These systems allow collaboration, enforce good coding practices and foster collaboration and sharing. The most widely used version control system today is [`git`](http://git-scm.com/). Git is free and open source.

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/getting_started/main/images/GitHub-Mark.png'  align='right' width=100 alt='GitHub logo'>In addition to using `git`, it is possible to use one of many online `git` hosting sites. For *Practicum AI* we use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). There are other options, but GitHub is one of the leading online hosting companies and offers [educational discounts for students and faculty](https://education.github.com/). This module will get you setup with a GitHub.com account and walk you through your first experience of using `git`.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Login to a Jupyter Lab environment.
1. Accept a GitHub Classroom assignment and clone the assignment into their Jupyter environment
1. Use the git flow workflow to edit a file, add the file, commit the changes and push changes to a remote repository.
1. Navigate the GitHub discussion board and issue system for getting help and reporting problems.

## Read

## Setting up your Jupyter environment

There are tailored instructions depending on how you are using this course.

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/practicumai.github.io/main/images/features/Jupyter_logo.svg' align='right' alt='Jupyter logo' style="padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px">Jupyter is an interactive coding environment that allows you to easily write and run code blocks, add nicely formatted documentation, and develop more complex applications. Because much of the AI workflow is exploring data and testing different models and parameters, the interactive, visual nature of Jupyter notebooks makes them ideal for the task and the industry standard.

Because there are many pathways to the *Practicum AI* courses, there are many options for how best to run the code for the course. We strive to make it easy to select the best option for you, though also acknowledge that your best option may change over time based on your access to resources and the tasks you are trying to accomplish. By providing information on multiple options, we hope to support you on a diverse array of industry leading resources.
