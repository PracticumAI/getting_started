## What is Practicum AI?

Welcome to the *Practicum AI: Getting Started with AI* Course! This course is intended to be the first in a series that will teach you some tools and techniques to begin training and deploying models on your own. The course can also be taken on its own to familiarize yourself with the important concepts in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Let’s start with the big picture. The *Practicum AI* program is designed to equip you with the tools and knowledge to execute *your own* AI project or mission.

To achieve this goal, the *Practicum AI* track features a lot of technical, hands-on learning experiences. We, the *Practicum AI* Team, think that a more important question than “What can we show you?” is, “What do you want to do? What problems or research questions interest you, and how can AI tools help?” Once you answer that, everything else falls into place. We believe the best learning happens when you have a clear goal in mind.

So, we encourage you to think of AI—not from a technical point of view—but as a new way of answering questions, delivering services, and solving problems.

Our target audience is beginners who have little-to-no technical background.

Again—this program is **not designed** for a highly technical audience. If you already have a strong technical background or multiple years of programming experience, there are more appropriate resources, including those offered by [NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/online/).

## In this course we’ll cover

* **Module 1: [What is AI?](/getting_started/01_what_is_ai):** A high-level overview of the concepts, history, and vocabulary of AI.
* **Module 2: [Understanding AI Models](/getting_started/02_understanding_ai_models):** Hands on experience with three AI models intended to prime understanding of how they work.
* **Module 3: [The AI Application Development Cycle](/getting_started/03_ai_application_development):** A crash course in the steps to develop an AI application.
* **Module 4: [A (Very Brief) Introduction to AI Ethics](/getting_started/04_brief_intro_ai_ethics):** A look at industry adopted principles that guide ethical AI development.

Good luck!
